          <h3>The Orthodox Wedding Ceremony</h3>

          <p>The wedding ceremony of the Greek Orthodox Church is an ancient and meaningful service that has been celebrated in its present form for centuries. The service is abundant with symbols that reflect marriage: love, mutual respect, equality and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>The ceremony consists of two parts which are distinct and separate from each other: The service of the Betrothal and the Ceremony of the Sacrament of Marriage. Everything in the ceremony has a special meaning and significance, especially the repetition of each act three times to symbolize and to invoke the mystical presence of the Holy Trinity.</p>

          <h2>The Service of Betrothal</h2>
          
          <p>Petitions are chanted for the spiritual welfare of the couple. The highlight during this service is the exchanging of the rings. The priest blesses the rings. He holds them in his right hand, and making the sign of the cross over their heads, he betroths the bride to the groom. The rings are then placed on their right hands. The koumbara (religious sponsor) then exchanges the rings three times. The exchange signifies that in married life, the weakness of one partner will be compensated by the strength of the other, the imperfections of one, by the perfection of the other.</p>

          <h2>The Ceremony of the Sacrament of Marriage</h2>

          <p>The ceremony consists of petitions, prayers, the crowning, readings from the New Testament, the offering of the common cup, the circling of the ceremonial table, and the benediction.</p>

          <h3>The Candles</h3>

          <p>After the betrothal service, the marriage ceremony begins. The priest lights two white candles, which he hands to the bride and groom. They will hold these throughout the service as a reminder of Christ’s light in their life. The priest then offers petitions for the health, happiness, and spiritual welfare of the couple.</p>

          <h3>The Joining of the Hands</h3>
          
          <p>The hands of the bride and groom are joined when the priest reads the prayer that petitions God to &quot;join these thy servants, unite them in one mind and one flesh.&quot; The couple’s hands are kept joined throughout the service to symbolize their union.</p>
          
          <h3>The Crowning</h3>

          <p>This is the focal point of the marriage ceremony. The crowns are signs of the glory and honor with which God crowns them during the sacrament. The wedding crowns (stefana) are joined by a ribbon which again symbolizes the unity of the couple and the presence of Christ who blesses and joins the couple and establishes them as the King and Queen of their home, which they will rule with wisdom, justice and integrity. The priest takes the two crowns and blesses the bride and the groom and then places the crowns on them. The koumbara then steps behind the bride and the groom and interchanges the crowns three times as a witness to the sealing of the union.</p>

          <h3>The Common Cup</h3>

          <p>The rite of crowning is followed by the reading of the Epistle and the Gospel. The Gospel reading describes the marriage at Cana of Galilee which was attended and blessed by Christ and for which He reserved His first miracle. There He converted the water into wine and gave of it to the newlyweds. In remembrance of this blessing, wine is given the couple. This is the &quot;common cup&quot; of life denoting the mutual sharing of joy and sorrow, the token of a life of harmony. The drinking of wine from the common cup serves to impress upon the couple that from that moment on they will share everything in life: joys, as well as sorrows, and that they are to &quot;bear one another’s burdens.&quot; Their joys will be doubled and their sorrows halved because they will be shared.</p>

          <h3>The Ceremonial Walk</h3>

          <p>The priest then leads the bride and the groom in a circle around the table on which are placed the Gospel and the Cross. The bride and the groom are taking their first steps as a married couple, and the church, in the person of the priest, leads them in the way they must walk.</p>

          <h3>The Blessing</h3>

          <p>At the conclusion of the Ceremonial Walk, the priest removes the crowns from the bride and the groom and beseeches God to grant to the newlyweds a long, happy and fruitful life together. He then lifts up the Gospel and separates their joined hands reminding them that only God can separate the couple from one another.</p>
