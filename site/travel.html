          <h3>Flights</h3>
          <p>If you are flying, we recommend you arrive at either J.F.K. International (JFK) or LaGuardia (LGA) airports. Your other option is Newark International (EWR), but it's harder (and more expensive) to get anywhere from Newark. Not that the others are a walk in the park for newcomers, either: from LaGuardia, there are a handful of buses that can get you to other places in the city; from J.F.K. you get that plus the AirTrain, which connects to the subway.</p>
          <p>You may find it easier to hail a cab or call for a car service (more on those later) than hauling your luggage onto a bus. However, this is the most expensive option of all with fares running about $50.</p>
          <p>When booking airfare, we like to set up a multi-front attack of <a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com">Airfare Watchdog</a>, <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a> alerts, and <a href="http://www.kayak.com">Kayak</a> price prediction.</p>
