          <h3>Flights</h3>
          <p>If you are flying, we recommend you arrive at either J.F.K. International (JFK) or LaGuardia (LGA) airports. Your other option is Newark International (EWR), but it's harder (and more expensive) to get anywhere from Newark. From LaGuardia, there are a handful of buses that can get you to other places in the city; from J.F.K. you can take a bus or  the AirTrain, which connects to the subway.</p>
          <p>You may find it easier to hail a cab or call for a car service (more on those later) than hauling your luggage onto a bus. However, this is the more expensive option of all with fares running about $50.</p>
          <p>When booking airfare, we like to get deals through sites like <a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com">Airfare Watchdog</a>, <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a>, and <a href="http://www.kayak.com">Kayak</a>.</p>

          <h3>Bus</h3>
          <p>Several bus lines make multiple trips each day between midtown Manhattan and the greater Boston area. It’s an inexpensive option but there are no seat assignments and you might be waiting outside to board.</p>

          <h3>Rail</h3>
          <p>Amtrak runs a train along the Northeast corridor. With a bit of luck and an early booking, you can get a sweet deal to Penn Station.</p>

          <h3>Public Transit</h3>
          <p>If you’re coming in from out of town, you might be surprised by the efficiency of New York’s subway system. It runs 24 hours a day and will be the best value for many trips through the city. Visit the MTA’s website for maps, trip planners, and fare information.</p>
          <a class="btn btn-default btn-sm" href="http://www.mta.info" role="button">MTA</a>
          <h3>Taxi</h3>
          <p>If you’re looking for more convenience, hail a taxi. (Look for the light on the taxi’s roof. If it’s illuminated, it’s available for hire.) Taxis in NYC accept cash or credit card and gratuity is expected. Note that it can be more difficult to find available taxis in Brooklyn than Manhattan.</p>

          <h3>Car Service</h3>
          <p>Calling for a car is a lot like reserving a taxi ahead of time. It can be more expensive than a taxi, but reserved just for you. Fares are pre-set and should be agreed upon when you call for a pickup.</p>
